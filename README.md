# crypto-api-dashboard
This is a cryptocurrency price tracker for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, DogeCoin, and Solana. The goal of this project was to make use of the useEffect hook to request data from a real API and render it onto a webpage. Users of this web application can view the current price and percent change of each of the tracked cryptocurrencies at the time of the page being loaded. Reloading the page will update it with more recent data. This project is still a work in progress. Future updates will include the ability to search up a cryptocurrency by its ticker and add it to the dashboard.<br>

The live webpage can be viewed at: [https://codesandbox.io/p/github/lpviray/crypto-api-dashboard/main?workspaceId=bf781ec0-363d-4854-99aa-c448ab72309f](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/lpviray/crypto-api-dashboard/main?workspaceId=bf781ec0-363d-4854-99aa-c448ab72309f)
